                Assignment on Authentication and Authorization
                    Their is an organization which has 3 teams
                        - Developer
                        - Devops
                        - Testing
                    First you need to create 9 dummy jenkins jobs.Each job will print their jobname, build number.
                        For Developer create 3 dummy jobs.In developer view
                            job1:- dev-1
                            job2:- dev-2
                            job3:- dev-3
                        For Testing create 3 dummy jobs. In testing view
                            job1:- test-1
                            job2:- test-2
                            job3:- test-3
                        For Devops create 3 dummy jobs. In devops view
                            job1:- devops-1
                            job2:- devops-2
                            job3:- devops-3
                
-------------------------------------------------   

I used DSL Script to create a 9 dummy jobs
 
            job('test-01') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('test-02') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('test-03') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('devops-01') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('devops-02') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('devops-03') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('dev-01') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('dev-02') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
            job('dev-03') {
              steps {
                shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
              }
            }
